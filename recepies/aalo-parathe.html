        <strong>Aaloo-Paratha</strong>
    </h2>
    <br>
    <h2><em>Recepie</em></h2>
    Aloo means “potato” and paratha means “flatbread” in Hindi, so the name is quite telling: aloo paratha is an unleavened whole wheat flatbread stuffed with a savory, spiced, mashed potato filling.

    Sometimes spelled Alu Paratha, this potato stuffed flatbread is a popular Indian breakfast that combines two of my favorite starches in a single delectable package.

    Crisp on the outside and tender on the inside, this humble meal is as comforting as a hug. What’s not to love?
    <br>
    <strong>Lets divide the steps to make an aaloo-partha into two parts :</strong>
    
    <ul>
        <li><em>Dough made from whole wheat flour</em></li>
        <li><em>Mashed potato stuffing</em></li>
    </ul>

    <strong>Dough made from whole wheat flour :</strong>
    <ol>
        <li>First, boil or steam 4 medium-sized potatoes in a pressure cooker, steamer or electric cooker. Add enough water in a 2-litre pressure cooker or pan to just barely cover the potatoes.</li>
        <li>If you haven’t done so yet, peel and chop the warm potatoes. Then mash the potatoes with a potato masher.
            <br>
            <em>If you don’t have a potato masher, use a box grater to grate them and then mash the potatoes with a fork.</em>
        </li>
        <li>The potatoes should be mashed very well, with no lumps, chunks or bits. Any lumps in the mix will cause the stuffing to leak out of the dough when rolling.</li>
        <li>
            Now add the following ingredients, feeling free to vary the spices as you like.
            <ul>
                <li>½ to 1 teaspoon finely chopped green chillies (1 to 2 green chilies) or serrano peppers</li>
                <li>¼ to ½ teaspoon punjabi garam masala powder or Garam Masala Powder</li>
                <li>¼ to ½ teaspoon kashmiri red chilli powder or cayenne pepper or paprika (optional)</li>
                <li>½ to 1 teaspoon dry mango powder (amchur powder) – or use lemon juice instead</li>
                <li>salt according to your taste</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>With a spoon, thoroughly mix the ground spices and green chilies into the mashed potatoes to get an even mixture. Set the prepared aloo stuffing aside.
            <br>
            <em>Note : 
            Do check the taste of the spiced mashed potato stuffing, adjusting the salt, red chilli powder, or dry mango powder if needed.
            </em>
        </li>
    </ol>

    <strong>Make The Dough</strong>
    <ol>
        <li> In a separate bowl, add 2 cups whole wheat flour (atta). Make a well in the center. Add ½ teaspoon salt (or to taste), 1 tablespoon oil or ghee, and roughly ⅓ to ½ cup water.
            <br>
            <em>Note : Be sure to add the water in portions as you go on mixing and kneading the dough. Do not all of the water at once.</em>
        </li>
        <li>Bring the mixture together and knead into a smooth, soft dough for 8 to 10 minutes. Add more water if needed. Cover and keep the dough aside, letting it rest for 20 to 30 minutes.</li>
    </ol>

    <em>Now we are ready with the the dough and the stuffing, now the only thing we have to do is to put them together and follow the steps given below:</em>

    <br>
    <strong>Stuff The Flatbread: Using <em>"Double Disc Method"</em></strong>
    <ol>
        <li>Pinch two small balls from the dough. Flatten them and dust with whole wheat flour.</li>
        <li>With a rolling pin, roll them into rounds roughly 4 to 5 inches in diameter. Try making both the discs the same size.</li>
        <li>On one of the discs, place the potato stuffing in the center, keeping about 1 inch empty space from the sides.</li>
        <li> Gently place the second circle on top.</li>
        <li>Press and seal the edges with your fingertips. If you are not able to seal the edges, then brush or spread some water on the edges and then seal.</li>
        <li> Dust some flour on the stuffed aloo ka paratha and start rolling.</li>
        <li> Roll the paratha into a round about 7 to 8 inches in diameter, or about the size of a normal roti or chapati.</li>
    </ol>
    <br>
    <strong>Now we need to cook this already delicious smelling stuffed dough which we rolled</strong>
    <ol>
        <li>On a hot tawa (skillet or griddle), place the rolled paratha. The tawa should be quite hot; cooking parathas at a low flame will harden them. Ideally, the finished parathas are crisp as well as soft.</li>
        <li> When the base is partly cooked, flip the paratha using a spatula. You will see some air pockets on this side.</li>
        <li>Spread some ghee or a neutral flavored oil (e.g. sunflower) on the partly cooked part.</li>
        <li>Flip again and you will see nice golden blisters on the second side. To clarify, the side which has been spread with ghee will be on the bottom.
            <br>
            This side has to be cooked more than the previous side.</li>
        <li>Spread some ghee on the second side facing you. A well-made and well-roasted alu paratha will always puff up when roasting.</li>
        <li>Flip again once or twice till both sides are cooked properly, with crisp brown spots. You should also press the alu paratha edges down with a spatula or spoon so that they are fried well. Repeat, making all parathas this way.</li>
    </ol>

        <strong>
            <em>If you are ready to eat NOW, you can also serve the aloo ka paratha directly from the tawa (skillet) to the serving plate.</em>
